# school-data-summary
Analysis of school and standardized testing data using Pandas DataFrames.

## Summary
This project was carried out using two datasets in CSV files; one containing student data and the other containing school data. Descriptive data frames were created to display information about both the school district as a whole and each specific school individually. The variables included: Number of students, Budget, and Math and Reading scores. Additional data frames were created to display the top and bottom performing schools regarding their passing rate among students. This dataset was further broken down to show performance based on grade level, school budget per student, school size, and school type.
